# FutureRPG
In this Project, we are going to explore the different game system settings in RPG games. First, we will look for past papers that discuss about RPG game design and we will try to build a model based on those researches. Then, we will apply our model into a demo game and distribute it to game communities to get feedbacks about the system we adapted. Finally, we will use those feedbacks to write a paper that compares our game system model with current mainstream RPG game setting model.
