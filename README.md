# FutureRPG
Project Idea:
Project Milestone 1 – Proposal Zichen Zheng
In this Project, we are going to explore the different game system settings in RPG games. First, we will look for past papers that discuss about RPG game design and we will try to build a model based on those researches. Then, we will apply our model into a demo game and distribute it to game communities to get feedbacks about the system we adapted. Finally, we will use those feedbacks to write a paper that compares our game system model with current mainstream RPG game setting model.
Motivation:
Zichen: I’m a hardcore video game lover and player and my favorite type of game is RPG (Role-Playing Game). In the game industry right now, there are several types of common game setting and system for RPG games. And based on my observation, many players would have a preferred setting and system. Since I want to join the game industry after graduation, I’d like to find out the type of game setting and system that fits the taste of most players. I also consider this as a chance for me to develop a game demo that can be showed in my resume. That’s why I picked up this project.
Gongyu: I love to play games and I play all types of games. When I was young, I always play games handheld. Pokémon is my favorite game and it let me know how interesting RPG game (Role play game) is. I am super lucky that I find a teammate who have a same hobby and who gives me an idea to develop an RPG game for our project. During this project, our goal is that try to find which kind of RPG game fit what generation and which kind of RPG game fit all generation.
Research Questions:
Team Members: Zichen Zheng and Gongyu Zhou
Proposed final deliverables:
• A working demo game built with different RPG game system, we will build the demo with Unity or RPG maker. The game will be on GitHub. We will distribute it to some game communities to gain our results.
• A written report based on the after-demo game survey
• An other survey report before the participants play the demo.
Proposed Schedule:
• Hopefully, we will do a weekly updated report on this project
• February 23th, we will begin to focus on one special design pattern that we want to build a
demo with
• February 28th, we will design a pre-demo survey
• March 14th, we will build our demo game and begin to release it to the game community.
• March 28th you will be able to pilot your user studies in class
• The week of April 7th there will be no class so you can run your user studies.
• April 20th. We will finish collecting game feedbacks and begin to write our paper.
• The final deliverable will be due Sunday May 5th at 11:59:59pm. Supporting Papers:
1. 2.
3. 4. 5. 6.
Initial Design Idea:
Our model might focus on the different roles player choose and how it affects the reviews from the players. Also we will also try to combine difficulty adjustment and the different game rewards scale in our demo. And in our gameplay, the demo should have a story that can affect the player’s emotion. This idea might be changed during our study. But this is the general idea of how our demo will look like.
